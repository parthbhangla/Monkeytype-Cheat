# Monkeytype-Cheat

I wanted to get familiar with selenium webdriver library on python so, I made this monkeytype-cheat which helps you type faster with the help of code.

This code works on various modes on monkeytype and you can increase or decrease the speed on your liking. Here's a demo of it working on 25 words with a delay of 0.2 seconds:

I took inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/dhravya" target="_blank">Dhravya</a>

# Instructions:

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/parthbhangla/monkeytype-cheater

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```sh
py main.py
```

You can change the time in time.sleep() in the cookies_selection function to increase or decrease the time you have to select a mode on the monkeytype page it opens up. Also, you can change the delay it asks you in the input for to increase or decrease the speed.
